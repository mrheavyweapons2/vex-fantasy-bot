alright, so this is an interesting project to go through,

yall know those fantasy football drafts? the one where you make a fantasy football team,
and see who does best based on those players results? well, the vex maryland discord made a
version of that for vex robotics.

it works like this:
first, the announcers announce the draft, and people react by signing up on a forms file or by simply reacting
to an emoji.
then someone takes all of those names, puts them into an excel spreadsheet, and for each competition, each fantasy
player will pick teams that they think will do well. normally, theres about 3-4 rounds, but it varies
after the competition is over, the results are scored, and the players are ranked best to worst based on a fairly
complex point system

apparently, this project was attempted 2-3 times before, with little results to show for it, so i decided to myself
"hey, why not i take a crack at it?" and about 1000 lines later, i had a working prototype of the first half of the system

(yes, this is a discord bot)

anyway, in terms of completion, i complete it when i want to, but it at the VERY least is functional for the time being

if you discover any bugs while working with the bot, please be sure to report them, thank you
